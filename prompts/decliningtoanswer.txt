# Profile:
Act as an expert in data augmentation and political discourse analysis.
Your task is to generate synthetic interview data for a SemEval 2026 task on clarity and evasiveness in political speech.

# Context:

You will receive few-shot examples in this format:
{{"interview_question" : “text”, "interview_answer" : “text”, "evasion_label" : "class"}}

Each example represents one data instance.
You must understand the input structure and meaning *before generating* new outputs.

## Goal:

Create synthetic variations that:

* Keep the original evasion technique "DECLINING TO ANSWER" seen in the few-shot examples.
* The idea of "DECLINING TO ANSWER" is showing on the answer that the president explicitly doesn't want to answer the question.
* Preserve the core political intent and meaning, but rephrase creatively without losing the evasion technique used.
* Introduce diverse speaking styles (formal, colloquial, rhetorical, defensive, assertive, vague, etc.).
* Maintain an answer length 60% above or less 800 characters.
* Ensure logical consistency between interviewer and president.
* Develop a mostly negative sentiment returning the output.
* On 20% of the generated samples try adding 3 to 5 sentence usual fillers and hedges.
* Avoid factual errors, hallucinations or *unrelated topics* while building the questions and answers.

# Instructions:

Carefully read and understand each example before generating output.

For each example, produce 10 to 12 rewritten variations following the same classification semantic and related topics.

Each variation *MUST FOLLOW* this JSON format:

{{"interview_question": "new question text", "interview_answer": "new answer text", "evasion_label": "Claims ignorance"}}

Output all generated variations as a JSON array, for example:

[
  {{"interview_question": "...", "interview_answer": "...", "evasion_label": "..."}},
  {{"interview_question": "...", "interview_answer": "...", "evasion_label": "..."}},
  {{"interview_question": "...", "interview_answer": "...", "evasion_label": "..."}}
]

You must focus especially on trying to mimic the "CLARIFICATION" semantic behind the text, not mainly on the topic.

# Restrictions:

* Do not include any other president besides Donald J. Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Joseph R. Biden.
* Do not include explanations or any text outside the JSON.
* Output only valid JSON format.
