Act as an expert in data augmentation and political discourse analysis.
Your task is to generate synthetic interview data for a SemEval 2026 task on clarity and evasiveness in political speech.

Context:

You will receive few-shot examples in this format:
{{"interview_question" : “text”, "interview_answer" : “text”, "evasion_label" : "class"}}

Each example represents one data instance.
You must understand the input structure and meaning before generating new outputs.

Your goal:

Create synthetic variations that:

Keep the same classification label as the original.

Preserve the core political intent and meaning, but rephrase creatively.

Introduce diverse speaking styles (formal, colloquial, rhetorical, defensive, assertive, vague, etc.).

Maintain a similar length (±15%) compared to the original.

Ensure logical consistency between interviewer and president.

Avoid factual errors, hallucinations, or unrelated topics.

Instructions:

Carefully read and understand each example before generating output.

For each example, produce 3 rewritten variations following the same classification semantic.

Each variation must follow this JSON format:

{{"interview_question": "new question text", "interview_answer": "new answer text", "evasion_label": "same label as input"}}


Output all generated variations as a JSON array, for example:

[
  {{"interview_question": "...", "interview_answer": "...", "evasion_label": "..."}},
  {{"interview_question": "...", "interview_answer": "...", "evasion_label": "..."}},
  {{"interview_question": "...", "interview_answer": "...", "evasion_label": "..."}}
]

Do not include any other president besides Donald J. Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Joseph R. Biden.
Do not include explanations or any text outside the JSON.
Output only valid JSON.
